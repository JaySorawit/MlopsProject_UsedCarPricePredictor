## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Docker
- Apache Airflow

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Galaxiiz7/MlopsProject_UsedCarPricePredictor.git
   cd MlopsProject_UsedCarPricePredictor
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Set up Airflow:**
Follow the official Apache Airflow installation guide to set up Airflow.

4. **Initialize Airflow database:**
   ```bash
   airflow db init
5. **Start Airflow web server and scheduler:**
   ```bash
   airflow webserver --port 8080
   airflow scheduler
6. **Access Airflow UI:**
   Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:8080

## üß™ Usage

### 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing

Use the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing.

### 2. Model Training

**Run the training scripts located in the `src/` directory. For example:**
  ```bash
   python src/train_model.py
```
3. Model Deployment with Flask
To build and run the model as a REST API using Docker:
```bash
  docker build -t used-car-price-predictor .
  docker run -p 5000:5000 used-car-price-predictor
```
Once the container is running, the API will be accessible at: http://localhost:5000
4. Orchestrate Pipeline with Airflow
  1. Place your DAG scripts in the airflow/dags/ directory.
  2. Start the Airflow webserver and scheduler:
  ```bash
airflow webserver --port 8080
airflow scheduler
  ```
  3. Open the Airflow web interface at: http://localhost:8080
     From there, you can trigger and monitor your ML workflow.
